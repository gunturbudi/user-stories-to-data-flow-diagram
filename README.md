# From User Stories to Data Flow Diagram
Automatic generation of User Stories to Data Flow Diagram

Change the input and output by opening the `main.py` code (currently, there is no command line argument).


There are some project dependencies that must be met in order for the main code to run:

1. Robustness Diagram Generation from Gilson et al. : https://bitbucket.org/mde4asd/ucscenario-gen
2. PA-DFD generation from Alshareef et al : https://github.com/alshareef-hanaa/PA-DFD-Paper
3. Privacy NER model from Herwanto et al : https://github.com/gunturbudi/ner-privacy-engineering

If you want to just inspect the output, check the DFD in the output folder.
